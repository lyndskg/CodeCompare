## Project Overview

CodeCompare is a comprehensive programming language comparator and learning guide that assists users in choosing the most suitable programming language for their goals. It empowers learners by providing in-depth analysis, pros and cons lists, Venn diagrams, and visualizations to help them make informed decisions about the programming languages they wish to learn.

Have you ever been overwhelmed by the sheer number of programming languages available and unsure which one to start learning? CodeCompare is here to simplify the process and guide you on your programming journey. Whether you are a beginner seeking the best language to start with or an experienced developer looking to expand your skillset, CodeCompare is your one-stop solution to assess, compare, and plan your learning path.

<a name="obj"></a>
### <ins>Objectives</ins>

CodeCompare is designed to empower users with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their programming journey. Whether you are looking to enhance your career, build exciting projects, or simply indulge in your passion for coding, CodeCompare is your trusted companion.

---------------------

<a name="uiux"></a>
## UI/UX
`eli5-chrome` offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, seamlessly blending into the browsing experience.\
The extension's efficient storage management ensures quick access to previously queried terms, enhancing response times for recurrent usage.

When hovering over a word/phrase, the extension provides a little drop-down widget containing the ELI5 definition.\
The widget promptly vanishes when the mouse moves away, ensuring an unobtrusive browsing experience.


Moreover, user privacy and data protection are at the forefront, as the extension does not collect or store any personal information, ensuring a secure and trustworthy environment.

## Usage

If a term/phrase has been queried on r/ELI5, users can view relevant comments sorted by Reddit's "top" mechanism. For terms not yet queried on r/ELI5, the extension generates pseudo-r/ELI5 explanations using machine learning techniques and data scraping.

The extension sources its knowledge directly from the r/ELI5 subreddit, renowned for its community-driven ELI5 explanations that break down complicated subjects into easily digestible nuggets of knowledge. When hovering over a word/phrase, the extension provides a little drop-down widget containing the ELI5 definition. The widget promptly vanishes when the mouse moves away, ensuring an unobtrusive browsing experience.

However, the wonders of `eli5-chrome` do not end there. For terms that have already been queried on r/ELI5, the extension goes a step further by presenting snippets of the top-rated comments, curated through Reddit's "top" sorting mechanism. This ensures users receive insights from diverse perspectives and in-depth understanding of the term's context.

But what about terms that have not been previously queried on r/ELI5? `eli5-chrome` does not leave users empty-handed. Leveraging state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the extension generates auto-generated pseudo-r/ELI5 explanations. Through data scraping and intelligent algorithms, `eli5-chrome` composes ELI5-style definitions, mimicking the subreddit's signature simplicity even for previously unexplored concepts.
