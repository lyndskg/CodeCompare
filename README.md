<a name="uiux"></a>
## UI/UX
`eli5-chrome` offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, seamlessly blending into the browsing experience.\
The extension's efficient storage management ensures quick access to previously queried terms, enhancing response times for recurrent usage.

When hovering over a word/phrase, the extension provides a little drop-down widget containing the ELI5 definition.\
The widget promptly vanishes when the mouse moves away, ensuring an unobtrusive browsing experience.


Moreover, user privacy and data protection are at the forefront, as the extension does not collect or store any personal information, ensuring a secure and trustworthy environment.

<a name="io"></a>
## Basic I/O Details

<a name="i"></a>
### Input:
> - Users provide input by hovering the cursor over a word/phrase on any webpage.
>   - When the user hovers the cursor over a word or phrase on any webpage, the extension detects the highlighted term and initiates a request for the ELI5 explanation.
>
<a name="o"></a>
### Output:
> - ELI5 definition appears in a drop-down widget, along with relevant r/ELI5 comments or auto-generated pseudo-r/ELI5 explanations.
>   - The ELI5 definition appears in a non-intrusive drop-down widget adjacent to the highlighted word/phrase.
>   - The widget disappears as soon as the mouse moves away from the term.
>   - If the word/phrase has been queried on r/ELI5, the widget will display relevant comments sorted by Reddit's "top" mechanism.
>   - If the term/phrase has not been queried yet on r/ELI5, the widget will show an auto-generated pseudo-r/ELI5 explanation using ML techniques and data scraping.

## Usage

If a term/phrase has been queried on r/ELI5, users can view relevant comments sorted by Reddit's "top" mechanism. For terms not yet queried on r/ELI5, the extension generates pseudo-r/ELI5 explanations using machine learning techniques and data scraping.

The extension sources its knowledge directly from the r/ELI5 subreddit, renowned for its community-driven ELI5 explanations that break down complicated subjects into easily digestible nuggets of knowledge. When hovering over a word/phrase, the extension provides a little drop-down widget containing the ELI5 definition. The widget promptly vanishes when the mouse moves away, ensuring an unobtrusive browsing experience.

However, the wonders of `eli5-chrome` do not end there. For terms that have already been queried on r/ELI5, the extension goes a step further by presenting snippets of the top-rated comments, curated through Reddit's "top" sorting mechanism. This ensures users receive insights from diverse perspectives and in-depth understanding of the term's context.

But what about terms that have not been previously queried on r/ELI5? `eli5-chrome` does not leave users empty-handed. Leveraging state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the extension generates auto-generated pseudo-r/ELI5 explanations. Through data scraping and intelligent algorithms, `eli5-chrome` composes ELI5-style definitions, mimicking the subreddit's signature simplicity even for previously unexplored concepts.
